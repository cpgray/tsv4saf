--------
need more care when grabbing xref json

1) check for 404 errors
2) check 'message-type' although with /works/ in the URL that should be 'work'
3) check 'message-version' to detect changes
4) url-encode DOIs
5) check agency before attempting to retrieve metadata for a DOI

from CrossRef API doc: https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc

Selecting which elements to return

Crossref metadata records can be quite large. Sometimes you just want a few
elements from the schema. You can "select" a subset of elements to return
using the select parameter. This can make your API calls much more efficient.
For example:

http://api.crossref.org/works?sample=10&select=DOI,title

NOTE: this does not work with a request for a specific DOI
--------
You should always url-encode DOIs and parameter values when using the API.
DOIs are notorious for including characters that break URLs (e.g. semicolons,
hashes, slashes, ampersands, question marks, etc.).
--------
The API will only work for Crossref DOIs. You can test the reistration agency
for a DOI using the following route:

https://api.crossref.org/works/{doi}/agency
